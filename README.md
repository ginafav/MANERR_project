This page contains all codes used for analyzing the following paper "Shifting Vegetation Zones Restructure Sediment Microbiomes and Viromes in a Mangroveâ€“Cordgrass Estuary". 
We sampled the Mud Island (MI) sediments within the Mission-Aransas National Estuarine Research Reserve (MANERR) 
The data obtained from the MI sites consists of 55 metagenomic samples and 1097 viral MAGs. 
The manuscript of this paper is currently drafted.
The datasets are included in the supplementary tables of the manuscript.
